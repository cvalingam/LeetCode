// Approach: A building receives sunlight if no taller or equal building blocks it from the left.
// Track a running maximum 'ptr' starting at arr[0]. Walk left-to-right: whenever arr[i] >= ptr,
// the building is visible (it is at least as tall as every building before it), so count it and
// update ptr to arr[i].
//
// Time: O(N) — single pass over the array.
// Space: O(1) — only two integer variables.
