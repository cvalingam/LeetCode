// Approach: Post-order DFS — recurse into both subtrees before deciding at each node.
// Base cases: return null for a null node; return the node itself if it equals p or q.
// After recursing left and right: if both return non-null, the current root is the LCA.
// If only one side is non-null, that value is the LCA candidate and propagates up.
// This single DFS pass handles all cases: p is ancestor of q, q is ancestor of p, and the general case.
// Time: O(n) Space: O(h) for the recursion stack where h is the tree height.
