// Approach: Two pointers starting at both ends of the array.
// The water volume between two lines equals the shorter height multiplied by the distance between them.
// Start with left=0 and right=n-1 to maximise the width, then shrink inward.
// Always advance the pointer at the shorter side — moving the taller side can only decrease area.
// Track the maximum area seen across all valid pairs.
// Time: O(n) Space: O(1)
