// Approach: Recursively compare both trees node by node.
// Base cases: both nodes null means identical; one null or mismatched values means not identical.
// A subtree is the same only if both its left and right subtrees are identical.
// Every node is visited exactly once — O(n) time. Recursion depth equals tree height O(h).
// Time: O(n) Space: O(h)
