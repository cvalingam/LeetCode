          <li><strong>Easy:</strong> One data structure or straightforward loop. Expected solve time: 5–10 minutes. These appear as warm-up questions or phone screens at most companies.</li>
          <li><strong>Medium:</strong> Requires combining 2–3 techniques. Expected solve time: 15–25 minutes. Most on-site interview questions are Medium difficulty.</li>
          <li><strong>Hard:</strong> Complex DP, advanced graph algorithms, or non-obvious observations. Expected solve time: 30–45 minutes. Appear in later rounds at FAANG-level companies.</li>

    q: 'What is time complexity and why does it matter?',
    a: (
      <>
        <p>
          Time complexity describes how the runtime of an algorithm scales with input size. Written as Big-O notation (O(n), O(n log n), O(n²), etc.), it lets interviewers and engineers compare algorithms without running them.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">It matters in interviews for two reasons:</p>
        <ul className="mt-1 space-y-1 list-disc list-inside text-sm">
          <li>Interviewers explicitly ask for it. You will not pass most on-site rounds without stating correct complexity.</li>
          <li>Problems have hidden time limits. A brute-force O(n²) solution may time out on 10⁵ inputs where an O(n log n) solution passes.</li>
        </ul>

GeeksforGeeks POTD (Problem of the Day) is the most popular daily coding challenge in India, and its community predominantly expects Java solutions. Maintaining both in a single site covers the two most common interview preparation workflows for Indian software developers.',
